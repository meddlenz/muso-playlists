		Your 'goose ID' is the variable at the end of your /play bookmarklet. Ask Liam for this if you don't have it, and <u><strong>do not share it with others</strong></u>. Sharing this will let others play videos under your name.<br /><br />Your /play bookmarklet should look somthing like this:<br />javascript:(async%20function%28%29%7Bdocument.body.insert.........<br /><br />Copy your /play bookmarklet, then go to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/">this website</a> to format it properly by clicking 'Decode'. Once your bookmarklet link has been decoded you should see your goose id at the end. It should look something like this:<br /><em>"&amp;goose=pavufo987285erlkovlh"</em><br /><br />Copy the ID value (the text after '&amp;goose=', and without quotes. This is the ID you need to use for this website. Do not share it with anybody!
